## Setting up a cohort

This is a quick start guide for the WDI team looking to get set up with Garnet.
Begin by navigating to the Garnet webpage: https://garnet.wdidc.org

### Signing Up
The first step in getting set up with Garnet is to sign in. Currently, all sign ins are done via Github. Begin by clicking the  **"Sign in with Github""** button:

![Sign In With Github](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/c058d18c-7209-4bb8-a4c2-449e9609e209/00000037.png)

**Important**
Before creating a Cohort on Garnet, make sure that all students, instructors, and teaching assistants have created an account with their github account.

### Starting a new cohort
There is currently no button that will take you to the page to start a new cohort, so you will need to navigate your browser to this URL for now:

**[Start a new cohort](https://garnet.wdidc.org/cohorts/new)**


Once you arrive, you should see a page that looks like this:
![Add new cohort page](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/80649836-eafa-43b1-b16a-1c41b2c24cc5/00000038.png)

**You will need to fill out this form as follows:**

1. **Name:** This part of the form will be the name of your cohort, the convention is to name is WDI and the number of the cohort, so for example, WDI-21.
2. **Location:** This will be the location of the GA organization you work for.
3. **Course:** This will be the program you teach for (Web Development Immersive = WDI).
4. **CoreID & Duration in weeks:** leave these blank.
5. **Day of week:** The day **before** your cohort starts, so if the first day is monday, set it to Sunday. This may change, if it does, please update this documentation.
6. **Start Date:** The day **before** your cohort starts, so if the first day is Febuary 27th, 2017, set it to Febuary 26th, 2017. Again, this may change, if it does, please update this documentation.

**Once all the above has been filled out, go ahead and click on create cohort.**

The cohort should now be added, and when we navigate back to our [main page](https://garnet.wdidc.org/), we should see a link to the new cohort under "Cohorts you admin".

![Cohort has been added](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/0ddea561-5aa7-4e9b-afc4-caf21bc98d61/00000039.png)

Let's go ahead and click on this link. This will bring us to our Cohorts page, if everything looks OK, then that's it! Congratulations you've now set up your cohort.

### Adding students & instructors to a cohort
After setting up a cohort, the next step is populate it with cohort admins, and students. The cohort admins will include yourself, your co-instructors, any TAs, and your program producer.

Let's start by adding our admins, on our **Cohort** page go ahead and click on the **Manage Cohort** button at the top:

![Manage Cohort Button](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/e1ac971f-b6a9-4239-bc38-a31d9c77d253/00000041.png)

This link takes us to the section where we add members.

Under the "Manage Memberships" Section, go ahead and type the names of all of your admins one at a time. A dropdown should appear showing you their name, go ahead and click their name, and then click "Is admin", and then finally click "add members".

![Adding an admin](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/c2133642-a344-4276-b03e-8ad1b914c0c8/00000042.png)

Great, now that we have added our admins to the cohort, time to add the students. **Make sure that you have had all students to Garnet by having them Sign in with their github accounts, otherwise they will not show up on the drop down**

Now go ahead and repeat the same process as we did before with students, by starting to type in the students **Github Handle**, if the github handle shows nothing, then try the students name. Again, clicking on their name or github handle when it drops down. The only difference is to **not** click the "Is admin" button. Go ahead and repeat this process for all students.

Once you have completed this for instructors and students, go ahead and fill out the form at the top of this page, under "Enter start time for events".

![Entering cohort start time](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/f0ee3271-0d7f-499c-b122-2df2d41c1ab0/00000044.png)

Go ahead and click "Auto populate events", and you're done! Now, if we go to our [main](https://garnet.wdidc.org) page, we should see all our students, admins, and attendance.

![Students added on main page](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/1697815f-9403-4fee-9813-41c98d2e2eee/00000045.png)

The last part of setting up the cohort is to scroll to the bottom of this page, and view our **attendance** section, which should look like this:

![Attendance Section](https://content.screencast.com/users/ddunn91/folders/Jing/media/1c9cc081-5e97-4462-afa2-674c9926e2da/00000040.png)

**Important**
Make sure you check this over, and make sure none of the dates are repeating themselves, and the given start date of the cohort is accurate. If it is not, it is because you did not set the starting cohort date to **a day before** the actual start date as specified during the form section of this guide.

If everything looks good then congratulations! You've set up the cohort and populated it with dates, students, and admins. Your cohort is now ready to be used and managed.
